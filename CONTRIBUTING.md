## Home

Project lives at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/tom.davidson/aws-mock-events) and mirrored on GitHub. Bring changes in from GitHub maybe a bit more hassel but 
worth figuring out how to do well.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
1. Update the README.md with details of changes.
1. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent.
1. The versioning scheme is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
